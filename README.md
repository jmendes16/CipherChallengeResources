# CipherChallengeResources
Scripts and that can be used and adapted for the University of Southampton Cipher Challenge

All files in this repository were taken from an old script I wrote in Python2.7, most things 
will still work but some things need updating (most common issue is print not having brackets).  

The primary purpose of this is to teach students how pre-18th Century cryptography and 
cryptanalysis works.  In my functions the encryption/decryption process has been explicitly
programmed, so the scripts are far from pythonic.  

Some functions are taken from a larger script so are written using OOP, the class methods 
are what might be useful to students.  

Suggested use: 
-Explain the relevant cryptographic concept.  
-present the skeleton of the python function or an occluded version of it.  
-have the student complete the script.  
-send/receive encrypted messages.
